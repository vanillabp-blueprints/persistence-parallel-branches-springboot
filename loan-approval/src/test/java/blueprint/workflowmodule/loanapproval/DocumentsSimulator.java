/**
 * The document service, as far as the test is concerned, plus the one thing that makes this
 * blueprint testable: it can be slow on purpose.
 *
 * <p>
 * The collision this blueprint is about needs both branches inside their transactions at the
 * same time. Waiting for that to happen by chance is a test which passes nineteen times out
 * of twenty and fails on the CI machine. So the test makes this call take a moment, answers
 * the other branch while it lasts, and asserts afterwards that both results are there.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The delay is bounded rather than a latch the test opens: a task handler holds a thread of
 * the BPMS, and on a remote engine that thread is shared by everything the adapter does. A
 * handler which blocks until somebody lets it go stalls the whole adapter, which is worth
 * knowing before writing one.
 * </p>
